- depth should be a tuple of interline_depth and intraline depth
    - the intra_depth should start at 0 for every line and go up 1 for every
    node that is thrown out
    the inter_depth should be set to whatever whitespace is being pulled off
    - this should allow the next line to be indented no matter how many statements
    were on the previous line

- tags should not actually hold the inline_content; their inner whitespace
  flag should be triggered instead and the child should be a normal child
    
- the compiler should have backend specific methods for the following:
    - boolean attributes (ie HTML vs XHTML versions)
    - expressions
    - control statements (start and end)


- id lists should be joined by '_'
- class lists should be joined by ' '
- attribute values that are dicts should be combined with '-'
    eg. %(data={'id': 4}) -> <div data-id="4">...</div>

- implement tests for all the examples in the haml tutorial

- all code generation should be yielding a sequence of tokens:
    - sentinal objects will be used for INC_DEPTH and DEC_DEPTH
    - indent(), endl are strings
    - strings for their contents
