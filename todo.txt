- rename nodes.Comment to nodes.HTMLComment
- rename nodes.Silent to nodes.HAMLComment
- rename nodes.Filtered to nodes.Filter
                                                
- blank lines should perhaps not be immediately tossed out.
	eg.:
		- content = """one
		    two

		    three"""
		= content  
	
	This will drop the blank line.   

- the compiler should have backend specific methods for the following:
    - boolean attributes (ie HTML vs XHTML versions)
    - expressions
    - control statements (start and end)

- control statements should not count for collapsing inner whitespace for tags

- boolean attributes should render without value

- doctypes

- implement tests for all the examples in the haml tutorial

- cleanup a lot of the strip commands in the tag; there are way to many after
  the nodes got control over the full rendering process

- boolean attributes

- empty inline expressions should have space around them.

    eg:
    
        %=
            'one'
            'two'
    
    should go to
    
        <div>
            one
        	two
        </div>
    
    but currently goes to
    
        <div>one
        	two</div>
    
    and gets compiled to
    
        <Document at 0x10113cb90>
        |   Tag(name='div') -> Expression('', '')
        |   |   Expression("'one'", '')
        |   |   Expression("'two'", '')
    
    Ways to do this:
        nodes should have a has_content() if it, and just it (not it's children)
        will result in some content
