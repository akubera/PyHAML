- tags should not actually hold the inline_content; their inner whitespace
  flag should be triggered instead and the child should be a normal child
    
- the compiler should have backend specific methods for the following:
    - boolean attributes (ie HTML vs XHTML versions)
    - expressions
    - control statements (start and end)

- control statements should not count for collapsing inner whitespace for tags

- boolean attributes should render without value

- doctypes

- implement tests for all the examples in the haml tutorial
