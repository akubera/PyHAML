- tags should not actually hold the inline_content; their inner whitespace
  flag should be triggered instead and the child should be a normal child
    
- the compiler should have backend specific methods for the following:
    - boolean attributes (ie HTML vs XHTML versions)
    - expressions
    - control statements (start and end)

- control statements should not count for collapsing inner whitespace for tags

- attribute values that are dicts should be combined with '-'
    eg. %(data={'id': 4}) -> <div data-id="4">...</div>
    - only need to do this for "data"

- implement tests for all the examples in the haml tutorial
