- name it 'paml'

- line continuations with backslash. do it before anything is parsed

- children get appended with add_child, then nodes can override this to
  throw exceptions when they shouldnt have children

- children_to_visit() on nodes by default returns the full child list
- children of an expression tag should all be content and get evaluated as well
- implement manual self closing tags

- figure out what the whitespace sets are for, and see if I can replace it with
  whitespace controls

- move main into paml.core

- the compiler should have backend specific methods for the following:
    - boolean attributes (ie HTML vs XHTML versions)
    - expressions
    - control statements (start and end)

- larger list of self-closing tags
    meta, img, link, script, br, and hr

- id lists should be joined by '_'
- class lists should be joined by ' '
- attribute values that are dicts should be combined with '-'
    eg. %(data={'id': 4}) -> <div data-id="4">...</div>

- implement tests for all the examples in the haml tutorial

- all code generation should be yielding a sequence of tokens:
    - sentinal objects will be used for INC_DEPTH and DEC_DEPTH
    - indent(), endl are strings
    - strings for their contents
