- Add LICENSE.md file.

- Extend the Mako loader class to automatically compile mako.
    - Make sure it caches the results!
    
- Start thinking about exception handling (and making sense of it)

- Rename nodes.Comment to nodes.HTMLComment.
- Rename nodes.Silent to nodes.HAMLComment.
- Rename nodes.Filtered to nodes.Filter.
                                                
- Blank lines should perhaps not be immediately tossed out.
    eg.:
        - Content = """one
            two

            three"""
        = content  
    
    This will drop the blank line.   

- The compiler should have backend specific methods for the following:
    - boolean attributes (ie HTML vs XHTML versions)
    - expressions
    - control statements (start and end)

- Can we support other engines?
    - Django
    - Jinja
    - Cheetah
    - Genshi (even though they already have something similar)
    - the one that comes with WerkZeug
    - really simple one that uses #{...} syntax
    
    Will likely need to not have arbitrary code inclusion, but I don't know
    if Haml actually specifies that you can do this. I can scan expressions
    for control structures to add a little bit more to it but that may be it.
