- start thinking about exception handling (and making sense of it)

- rename nodes.Comment to nodes.HTMLComment
- rename nodes.Silent to nodes.HAMLComment
- rename nodes.Filtered to nodes.Filter
                                                
- blank lines should perhaps not be immediately tossed out.
    eg.:
        - content = """one
            two

            three"""
        = content  
    
    This will drop the blank line.   

- the compiler should have backend specific methods for the following:
    - boolean attributes (ie HTML vs XHTML versions)
    - expressions
    - control statements (start and end)

- can we support Django templates?
